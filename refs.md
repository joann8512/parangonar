Several publications are associated with models available in **Parangonar**.
Please refer to them for detailed algorithm descritions and evaluation and cite them if you use parangonar for a publication.

The anchor point-enhanced `AnchorPointNoteMatcher` and the automatic `AutomaticNoteMatcher` are this described in:

```
@article{nasap-dataset,
 title = {Automatic Note-Level Score-to-Performance Alignments in the ASAP Dataset},
 author = {Peter, Silvan David and Cancino-Chac√≥n, Carlos Eduardo and Foscarin, Francesco and McLeod, Andrew Philip and Henkel, Florian and Karystinaios, Emmanouil and Widmer, Gerhard},
 doi = {10.5334/tismir.149},
 journal = {Transactions of the International Society for Music Information Retrieval {(TISMIR)}},
 year = {2023}
}
```

and the `AnchorPointNoteMatcher` is used in the creation of the [note-aligned (n)ASAP Dataset](https://github.com/CPJKU/asap-dataset).

The improved automatic `DualDTWNoteMatcher` and the online / realtime `OnlineTransformerMatcher` / `OnlinePureTransformerMatcher` are described in:
